This repository contains notebooks to check the visibility of different targets from AuxTel's location at Cerro Pach√≥n for a given date. 

They are greatly inspired by Sylvie Dagoret's notebooks concieved for the same task (https://github.com/sylvielsstfr/AuxtelStarAlt/tree/main). The tutorial notebooks by Manon Marchand (https://github.com/cds-astro/tutorials/tree/master/Past_Conferences_and_Schools/2024-11-14_ADASS) for the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center (CDS, https://cds.u-strasbg.fr/) have served of great inspiration as well. 

The notebooks here are thought to prepare spectroscopic observations with AuxTel for spectro-flats, but can be easily generalised to any other case.
